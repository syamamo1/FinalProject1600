Dynamic tennis ball simulation - drag force, lift force, laminar flow, turbulent flow, gravity, bounce dynamics


To run simulation, go to file named: Graphing.py and change values of initial x,y,z coordinates, linear velocities, 
and angular velocities. Then, run the program in a python interpreter (not command line).
